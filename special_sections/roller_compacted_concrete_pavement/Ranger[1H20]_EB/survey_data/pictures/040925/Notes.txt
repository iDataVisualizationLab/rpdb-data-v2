The roller-compacted concrete pavement (RCCP) section located within a rest area was evaluated, and several performance concerns were identified. The slabs exhibited excessive cracking, with wide crack openings observed across much of the section. In addition to transverse and longitudinal cracks, several corner cracks and punchouts were also present, indicating structural degradation. Faulting was also observed at the joints.

A notable issue was the presence of extensive longitudinal cracking. These cracks are likely a result of the large joint spacing, which was measured to be approximately 20 feet. This spacing exceeds the TxDOT recommendation to include longitudinal joints when slab widths exceed 15 feet, and the absence of such joints may have contributed to uncontrolled crack development.

MIRA testing revealed that the slab thickness is highly inconsistent across the section, with values ranging from 8 inches to as much as 14 inches. This variability in thickness could affect stress distribution and lead to uneven performance across the pavement. Some areas have already undergone partial repairs, where 8-inch-thick precast concrete panels were installed to replace deteriorated RCCP segments. Overall, the observed distresses suggest deficiencies in design detailing and construction quality, particularly related to joint layout and thickness control.
