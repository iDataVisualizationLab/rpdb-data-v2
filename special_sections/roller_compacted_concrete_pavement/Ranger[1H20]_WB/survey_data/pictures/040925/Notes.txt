The westbound (WB) section, also located within a rest area, was found to be in better condition compared to the eastbound counterpart. The ride quality was noticeably smoother, primarily due to diamond grinding that had already been performed on this section. As a result, no faulting was observed along the wheel paths, in contrast to the eastbound section where faulting was present.

Some longitudinal cracks were observed, though they were fewer and less severe than in the eastbound section. MIRA testing revealed variable slab thicknesses across the section. Thicker slabs were measured in the travel lanes, while the parking areas had comparatively thinner sections.
